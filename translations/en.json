            "long_desc_1": "The behavior of toddlers is often unpredictable. One moment, they want to be held in your arms, seeking safety and closeness, while the next, they can't wait to run around freely and explore the world. This duality is a natural part of their development, as they simultaneously crave parental closeness and the experience of independence. To meet these ever-changing needs, flexible and practical solutions are essential. Lifty hip carriers allow us to quickly adapt to the varying demands of our children while also making everyday life easier for parents.",

Thanks to their ergonomic design, wide, soft, and adjustable shoulder straps, they help distribute the weight properly, reducing the pressure on your shoulders. This unisex product will be loved by both women and men. This is not a baby carrier! Designed with great care and love for short distances, exclusively for toddlers, from approximately 9 months to 4 years old, but with a maximum weight limit of 20 kg.",
            "dotted_desc_1": "Shoulder Strap: 2 cm thick, specially firm, high-quality foam that provides ergonomic support and comfort. Thanks to its elasticity and shape-retaining properties, it fits snugly on the shoulder, distributes the weight, and reduces pressure points. The buckle is designed to sit on the foam, so it doesn’t press into the shoulder. Its durable material retains its shape over the long term and resists wear, ensuring the shoulder strap remains flawless even after years of use.",
            "dotted_desc_2": "Buckle: YKK buckle. These buckles are renowned for their excellent quality and reliability. They are extremely durable, have a long lifespan, and provide strong support, which is essential for safety. YKK also commits to sustainability, striving for environmentally friendly manufacturing processes and material usage, making their products not only reliable but also eco-friendly.",
            "dotted_desc_3": "Strap: 75 cm long and 5 cm wide polypropylene. The PP strap is strong and secure, yet lightweight, so it doesn’t significantly increase the carrier’s weight. It is water- and UV-resistant, making it durable and resistant to environmental factors, as well as easy to clean, which is practical for everyday use. Its elasticity ensures comfortable wear and guarantees a long lifespan.",
            "dotted_desc_4": "Seat: Made from 100% cotton with OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 certification. This is a textile material that meets the internationally recognized OEKO-TEX® Standard 100. This certification guarantees that the cotton material is free from harmful chemicals and is safe for skin contact, which is especially important for children."
